conformal field theories. Questions associated with non-zero temperature
dynamics and transport are difficult to answer using conventional field
theoretic methods. I argue that many of these can be addressed systematically
using gauge-gravity duality, and discuss the prospects for reliable computation

  Compressible quantum matter is characterized by the smooth dependence of the
charge density, associated with a global U(1) symmetry, upon a chemical
potential. Familiar examples are solids, superfluids, and Fermi liquids, but
there are more exotic possibilities involving deconfined phases of gauge fields
in the presence of Fermi surfaces. I survey the compressible systems studied

leads naturally to compressible phases which are superfluids, solids, or
non-Fermi liquids which are more appropriately called `Bose metals' in the

of gauge-charged fermions, even in cases where the parent CFT can be expressed
solely by bosonic degrees of freedom. Monopole operators are identified as

of the theory of emergent gauge fields in insulators in an intuitive manner. In
metals, Fermi liquid theory relies on adiabatic continuity from the free
electron state, and its central consequence is the existence of long-lived
electron-like quasiparticles around a Fermi surface enclosing a volume
determined by the total density of electrons, via the Luttinger theorem.
However long-range entanglement and emergent gauge fields can also be present
in metals. I focus on the ""fractionalized Fermi liquid"" (FL*) state, which also

Luttinger theorem on the Fermi volume is violated, and this requires the
presence of emergent gauge fields, and the associated loss of adiabatic
continuity to the free electron state. Finally, I present a brief survey of

The Luttinger relation, relating the area enclosed by the Fermi surfaces to the

critical region of a zero temperature quantum critical point (QCP) at hole
density x=x_m, near optimal doping. A long-standing problem with this picture
is that low temperature experiments within the superconducting phase have not
shown convincing signatures of such a optimal doping QCP (except in some
cuprates with small superconducting critical temperatures). I review
theoretical work which proposes a simple resolution of this enigma.
  The crossovers in the normal state are argued to be controlled by a QCP at
x_m linked to the onset of spin density wave (SDW) order in a ""large"" Fermi
surface metal, leading to small Fermi pockets for x<x_m. A key effect is that
the onset of superconductivity at low temperatures disrupts the simplest

competition between superconductivity and SDW order_shifts_ the actual QCP to a
lower doping x_s < x_m in the underdoped regime, so that SDW order is only

characterized by the expulsion of defects, carrying $Z_2$ magnetic flux. The
interplay between topological order and the breaking of global symmetry is
described by the non-zero temperature statistical mechanics of classical XY
models in dimension $D=3$; such models also describe the zero temperature
quantum phases of bosons with short-range interactions on the square lattice at
integer filling. The topological state is again characterized by the expulsion
of certain defects, in a state with fluctuating symmetry-breaking order, along
with the presence of emergent gauge fields. The phase diagrams of the $Z_2$
gauge theory and the XY models are obtained by embedding them in U(1) gauge
theories, and by studying their Higgs and confining phases. These ideas are
then applied to the single-band Hubbard model on the square lattice. A SU(2)
gauge theory describes the fluctuations of spin-density-wave order, and its
phase diagram is presented by analogy to the XY models. We obtain a class of
zero temperature metallic states with fluctuating spin-density wave order,
topological order associated with defect expulsion, deconfined emergent gauge
fields, reconstructed Fermi surfaces (with `chargon' or electron-like
quasiparticles), but no broken symmetry. We conclude with the application of
such metallic states to the pseudogap phase of the cuprates, and note the
recent comparison with numerical studies of the Hubbard model and photoemission
observations of the electron-doped cuprates. In a detour, we also discuss the
influence of Berry phases, and how they can lead to deconfined quantum critical
points: this applies to bosons on the square lattice at half-integer filling,
and to quantum dimer models."

spin. With full SU(2) spin rotation invariance, we find a magnetically ordered
ground state with Neel order at weak coupling, and a confining paramagnetic
ground state with bond charge (e.g. spin Peierls) order at strong coupling. We
study the mechanisms by which these two states are connected in intermediate
coupling. We extend the minimal model to study different routes to
fractionalization and deconfinement in the ground state, and also generalize it
to cases with a uniaxial anisotropy (the spin symmetry group is then U(1)). For
the latter systems, fractionalization can appear by the pairing of vortices in
the staggered spin order in the easy-plane; however, we argue that this route
does not survive the restoration of SU(2) spin symmetry. For SU(2) invariant

co-efficients are not proportional to a mean free scattering time (as is the
case in the Boltzmann theory of quasiparticles), but are completely determined
by the absolute temperature and by equilibrium thermodynamic observables.
Recently, explicit solutions of this quantum critical dynamics have become
possible via the AdS/CFT duality discovered in string theory. This shows that
the quantum critical theory provides a holographic description of the quantum
theory of black holes in a negatively curved anti-de Sitter space, and relates
its transport co-efficients to properties of the Hawking radiation from the
black hole. We review how insights from this connection have led to new results
for experimental systems: (i) the vicinity of the superfluid-insulator
transition in the presence of an applied magnetic field, and its possible
application to measurements of the Nernst effect in the cuprates, (ii) the
magnetohydrodynamics of the plasma of Dirac electrons in graphene and the
prediction of a hydrodynamic cyclotron resonance."
http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.0005v5	2009-03-13T10:14:04Z	"We propose a theory for the underdoped hole-doped cuprates, focusing on the
""nodal-anti-nodal dichotomy"" observed in recent experiments. Our theory begins
with an ordered antiferromagnetic Fermi liquid with electron and hole pockets.
We argue that it is useful to consider a quantum transition at which the loss
of antiferromagnetic order leads to a hypothetical metallic ""algebraic charge
liquid"" (ACL) with pockets of charge -e and +e fermions, and an emergent U(1)
gauge field; the instabilities of the ACL lead to the low temperature phases of
the underdoped cuprates. The pairing instability leads to a superconductor with
the strongest pairing within the -e Fermi pockets, a d-wave pairing signature
for electrons, and very weak nodal-point pairing of the +e fermions near the
Brillouin zone diagonals. The influence of an applied magnetic field is
discussed using a proposed phase diagram as a function of field strength and
doping. We describe the influence of gauge field and pairing fluctuations on
the quantum Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the normal states induced by the
field. For the finite temperature pseudogap region, our theory has some
similarities to the phenomenological two-fluid model of -2e bosons and +e
fermions proposed by Geshkenbein, Ioffe, and Larkin [cond-mat/9609209], which
describes anomalous aspects of transverse transport in a magnetic field."
http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.2348v3	2009-06-12T11:31:34Z	"We calculate the normal state Nernst signal in the cuprates resulting from a
reconstruction of the Fermi surface due to spin density wave order. An order
parameter consistent with the reconstruction of the Fermi surface detected in
electron-doped materials is shown to sharply enhance the Nernst signal close to
optimal doping. Within a semiclassical treatment, the obtained magnitude and
position of the enhanced Nernst signal agrees with Nernst measurements in
electron-doped cuprates."
http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3530v2	2009-10-06T13:02:11Z	"We study experimental signatures of the Ising nematic quantum phase
transition in d-wave superconductors, associated with the change of lattice
symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic in the superconducting state. The
characteristic feature of this transition is that the ratio between the Fermi
velocity $v_F$ and gap velocity $v_\Delta$ flows to a maximally anisotropic
fixed point, i.e. the renormalization group fixed point is situated at
(v_\Delta/v_F)^*=0$. Our main point is that the logarithmic approach to this
fixed point has visible signatures in the thermal transport. The analysis of
the quasiparticle contribution to the thermal transport is carried out in the
framework of a kinetic approach, which shows that the thermal conductivity is
enhanced near the nematic critical point. Another aspect of our study is the
interplay of dilute disorder and electronic interactions in the measured
thermal transport coefficients."
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5022v2	2011-05-20T19:21:57Z	"We give a unified overview of the zero temperature phases of compressible
quantum matter: i.e. phases in which the expectation value of a globally
conserved U(1) density, Q, varies smoothly as a function of parameters.
Provided the global U(1) and translational symmetries are unbroken, such phases
are expected to have Fermi surfaces, and the Luttinger theorem relates the
volumes enclosed by these Fermi surfaces to <Q>. We survey models of
interacting bosons and/or fermions and/or gauge fields which realize such
phases. Some phases have Fermi surfaces with the singularities of Landau's
Fermi liquid theory, while other Fermi surfaces have non-Fermi liquid
singularities. Compressible phases found in models applicable to condensed
matter systems are argued to also be present in models obtained by applying
chemical potentials (and other deformations allowed by the residual symmetry at
non-zero chemical potential) to the paradigmic supersymmetric gauge theories
underlying gauge-gravity duality: the ABJM model in spatial dimension d=2, and
the N=4 SYM theory in d=3."
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6532v2	2014-10-07T19:20:58Z	"Metals interacting via short-range antiferromagnetic fluctuations are
unstable to sign-changing superconductivity at low temperatures. For the
cuprates, this leading instability leads to the well known $d-$wave
superconducting state. However, there is also a secondary instability to an
incommensurate charge density wave, with a predominantly $d-$wave form factor,
arising from the same antiferromagnetic fluctuations. Recent experiments in the
pseudogap regime of the hole-doped cuprates have found strong evidence for such
a charge density wave order and, in particular, the predicted $d-$wave form
factor. However, the observed wavevector of the charge order differs from the
leading instability in Hartree-Fock theory, and is that of a subleading
instability. In this paper, we examine the feedback of superconducting
fluctuations on these different charge-density wave states, and find that over
at least a small temperature window, they prefer the experimentally observed
wavevector."
